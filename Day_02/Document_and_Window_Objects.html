      <div><h1>Document and Window Objects</h1></div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Two of the most significant objects in JavaScript are the window and
          document objects. They give access to the HTML document and the
          browser window, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          The HTML document loaded in the browser window is represented by the
          Document Object in web development. The document's browser window is
          represented by the Window Object. The location object and setTimeout
          method are two of the many helpful properties of the window object,
          which is the top-level object in the DOM hierarchy. The document
          object, a property of the window object, is used to access the
          currently loaded webpage and displays any HTML documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The window object is endowed with a number of beneficial properties,
          including length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, whether it has been
          closed, its parents, and more. The page's contents are contained in
          the document object.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>(BOM) Browser Object Model</h2>
        <p>
          The current browser window or tab is represented by objects in the
          browser object model. The window object, which sometimes represents a
          window, tab, or an iframe, is the topmost item in the BOM. The
          properties of a window object include things like location, screen
          information, and browser history. A window object in a multi-tab
          browser represents a single tab, but certain of its properties, such
          as innerHeight and innerWidth, and methods, such as resizeTo(), have
          an impact on the entire browser window.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>(DOM) Document Object Model</h2>
        <p class="firstPara">
          When you load a web page, the browser builds a Document Object Model
          for the page. As a tree of objects (HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML
          tags), the document object represents the entire HTML page. The HTML
          document is represented by this root element.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The browser window itself is represented by the window object. The
            title, URL, and size are just a few of the attributes and methods
            that provide you access to and control over the window. All other
            objects in the browser are available through the window object since
            it is the root of the browser's object model.
          </li>
          <li>
            The HTML document that is open in the window is represented by the
            document object. The title, body, and elements are just a few of the
            properties and methods that provide you access to and control over
            the document. The DOM (Document Object Model), a tree-like structure
            that represents the HTML document, has its root in the document
            object.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Properties</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The size, title, and URL of the browser window are among the
            properties of the window object. For instance, the window.location
            property returns the URL of the page that is presently loaded in the
            window, and the window.title property returns the title of the
            window.
          </li>
          <li>
            The title, body, and elements of the HTML document are among the
            properties of the document object. For instance, the document.body
            property returns the document's body, whereas the document.title
            property returns the document's title.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The window object includes methods that let you interact with the
            browser window, such as opening new windows, shutting windows, and
            showing notifications. For instance, the window.open() and
            window.alert() methods launch new windows, respectively, and display
            alert messages.
          </li>
          <li>
            The document object provides methods that let you interact with the
            HTML document, such as retrieving and altering the text of elements
            and adding and removing elements. For instance, the document and the
            element with the supplied ID are returned by the document.
            getElementById() method. The first element that matches the supplied
            selection is returned by the querySelector() function.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Initial object model node</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The window object is the root of the browser's object model (BOM),
            which implies that it provides access to all other objects in the
            browser. When using the window.document property, for instance, the
            document object is available.
          </li>
          <li>
            The root of the DOM (Document Object Model), which is a tree-like
            structure that represents the HTML document, is the document object.
            This indicates that every component of the document is reachable via
            the document object.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Two of the most significant objects in JavaScript are the window and
          document objects. They give access to the HTML document and the
          browser window, respectively. The document object is the root of the
          DOM, whereas the window object is the root of the browser's object
          model. The window object is typically used to gain access to browser
          window-specific attributes and functions, such as the title, URL, and
          size. The document object will be used to gain access to elements like
          the title and body, as well as other HTML-related properties and
          methods.
